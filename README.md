Hi everybody !

I'm happy to show you my OWN ransomware !

(This script is not for all script kiddie ! You should do some edits for reach your goal !)

Line 31 to line 142 I put shit code for a good obfuscation. Then I list every hard disk.(I don't use a variable for list every hard disk because I had some bugs with it)

After this you have 3 txt files. The first (READ_me.txt) is the file where you have all payment conditions ect... In the second file (TheKey.txt) you have the "decrypt key".
And in the last file you have a good message for prevention.

Then the browser open the bitcoin site for do the transaction.
The ransomware also change the wallpaper. 
And for finish the program create a graphical interface with some slogan, messages ect...


IMPORTANT : The ransomware just encrypt the .rtf files so add the extensions who you want to encrypt. And this ransomware DON'T HAVE ANY DECRYPT KEY SO IF YOU ENCRYPT NOTHING WILL BE DECRYPT !!! 

I ADVICE YOU TO ADAPT THE SCRIPT TO YOUR PERSONNAL NEEDS !

AND FOR FINISH I DON'T CARE ABOUT EDUCATIONAL AND PROPOSE ONLY !
